Android-Bootstrap
=================

**NOTE TO PREVIOUS USERS**
* You will need to remove any imports in your project and re-import in your java files, and change the component names in your layouts - this was because the package names didn't change when I renamed my library project, hopefully they make a lot more sense now.
* It was brought up that the layout attributes weren't actually unique which caused an issue if you had more than one library. I have prefixed all Bootstrap button attributes with "bb_" and Font Awesome Text with "fa_" so hopefully it won't ever be an issue in future.

Apologies for any inconvenience these changes may cause, hopefully this means there won't be any more updates which break previous versions in future!
