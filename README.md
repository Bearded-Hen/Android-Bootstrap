Android-Bootstrap
=================

**NOTE TO PREVIOUS USERS**
* You will need to remove any imports in your project and re-import - this was because the package names were innacurate, hopefully they're much tidier now
* It was brought up that the layout attributes weren't actually that unique which caused an issue if you had more than one library for a project. I have prefixed all Bootstrap button attributes with "bb_" and Font Awesome Text with "fa_" so hopefully it won't ever be an issue in future.

Apologies for any inconvenience this may cause, hopefully this means there won't be any more updates which break previous versions in future!
